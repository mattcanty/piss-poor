# Piss-Poor

> "I say Johnson, this website is piss-poor!" - Abraham Lincoln, 1850.

**Do you get the unending urge to throw your phone in the bin whenever you use a mobile *friendly* website?**

## Why Piss-Poor

I wish that every website I visited, every app I used, every program I downloaded could be a delightful and breezy experience.

In reality it is nothing like this.

It *seems* that the majority mobile site I visit has a sub-par user experience. The aim of this project is to capture evidence of this.

There is the problem, it only *seems* this way. Without collated evidence how can we possibly tell for sure?

Sorry Jane.
